# Simulation API

This will need to be running on the start up of the Unity simulation. To install, run either `install.bat` or `install.sh` to install the virtual environment. Ensure you run this with a Python version of <3.12.
To activate the API, use `run.bat` or `python api.py` in the command line once the virtual environment has been activated.

Before starting, you must also have placed the appropriate LLM models and tokenisers in the correct folders; e.g. for a BERT model, the model must be placed in `models/bert/model` and the tokeniser in `models/bert/token`.
