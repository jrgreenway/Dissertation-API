# Simulation API

This will need to be running on the start up of the Unity simulation. To install, run either `install.bat` or `install.sh` to install the virtual enviroment. Ensure you run this with a python version of <3.12.
To activate the api, use `run.bat`, or use `python api.py` in the command line once the virtual enviroment has been activated.
